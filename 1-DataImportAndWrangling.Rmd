### Purpose

Purpose of the codes is to ingest, format, wrangle, and amalgamate the resposne and predictor data needed for the Parks VIC HMSC project. 
This is a set up chunk of codes that ideally will be ran once and then the derivatives from it can be used in the future without needing to re-run.
